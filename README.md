# randomObjectGenerator
The function generates an object with random key-value pairs based on a JSON schema. 
All keys are generated randomly along with random values, with the exception of required keys — they are always generated, but their values are also random.

Unit tests are used for verification.

The front-end part is absent — all metrics are displayed in the console.
